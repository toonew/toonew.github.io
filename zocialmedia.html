  Zombies get bored too. Sometimes they just want to talk to a friend of find a local hookup to go out an eat human flesh together.  Thats why social media for your zombie is important. Not only does it keep them occupied, but it also makes your life easier by, making it so that you dont have to entertain them 24/7. With revolutionary apps like Zinder, Zomb-book, and Zwitter your zombie will only be clicks away from being out of your hair.
